<h2>Vera, or the Nihilists</h2>

<h3>ACT II - This shows the description about the Act II in Vera, or the Nihilists. 
    I have extracted my few lines in the play.</h3>
    
<p style="white-space: pre">

<p class="stage_directions">SCENE.--_Council Chamber in the Emperor's Palace, hung with yellow
    tapestry. Table, with chair of State, set for the Czar; window behind,
    opening on to a balcony. As the scene progresses the light outside gets
    darker._</p>

<p>_Present._--PRINCE PAUL MARALOFFSKI, PRINCE PETROVITCH, COUNT ROUVALOFF,
    BARON RAFF, COUNT PETOUCHOF.</p>


<h5 class="name prince_petro nameHover">PRINCE PETRO.</h5> <p class="speech">So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
    at last, and is to take his seat here again.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_paul nameHover">PRINCE PAUL.</h5> <p>Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
    own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_petro nameHover">PRINCE PETRO.</h5> <p>Naturally; you are always speaking.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_paul nameHover">PRINCE PAUL.</h5> <p>No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.</p>

<h5 class="name count_r nameHover">COUNT R.</h5> <p>Still, anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
    like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_paul nameHover">PRINCE PAUL.</h5> <p>My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
    world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
    to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place.</p> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_Enter the
        CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._)</p> <p>Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
            Highness is looking a little pale to-day.</p>
