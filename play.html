<h3>ACT II - This shows the description about the Act II in Vera, or the Nihilists. 
    I have extracted my few lines in the play.</h37>
    
<p style="white-space: pre">

<p class="stage_directions">SCENE.--_Council Chamber in the Emperor's Palace, hung with yellow
    tapestry. Table, with chair of State, set for the Czar; window behind,
    opening on to a balcony. As the scene progresses the light outside gets
    darker._</p>

<p>_Present._--PRINCE PAUL MARALOFFSKI, PRINCE PETROVITCH, COUNT ROUVALOFF,
    BARON RAFF, COUNT PETOUCHOF.</p>


<h5 class="name prince_petro">PRINCE PETRO.</h5> <p class="speech">So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
    at last, and is to take his seat here again.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_paul">PRINCE PAUL.</h5> <p>Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
    own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_petro">PRINCE PETRO.</h5> <p>Naturally; you are always speaking.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_paul">PRINCE PAUL.</h5> <p>No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.</p>

<h5 class="name count_r">COUNT R.</h5> <p>Still, anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
    like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_paul">PRINCE PAUL.</h5> <p>My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
    world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
    to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place.</p> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_Enter the
        CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._)</p> <p>Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
            Highness is looking a little pale to-day.</p>

<h5 class="name czare">CZARE.</h5> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_slowly, after a pause_).</p> <p>I want change of air.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_paul">PRINCE PAUL</h5> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_smiling_).</p> <p>A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial
    father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in
    Russia.</p>

<h5 class="name czare">CZARE.</h5> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_bitterly_).</p> <p>My Imperial father had kept me for six months in
    this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see
    some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery,
    though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_paul">PRINCE PAUL.</h5> <p>When you are as old as I am, Prince, you will understand
    that there are few things easier than to live badly and to die well.</p>

<h5 class="name czare">CZARE.</h5> <p>Easy to die well! A lesson experience cannot have taught you,
    whatever you may know of a bad life.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_paul">PRINCE PAUL</h5> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_shrugging his shoulders_).</p> <p>Experience, the name men give
    to their mistakes. I never commit any.</p>

<h5 class="name czare">CZARE.</h5> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_bitterly_).</p> <p>No; crimes are more in your line.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_petro">PRINCE PETRO.</h5> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_to the CZAREVITCH_).</p> <p>The Emperor was a good deal
    agitated about your late appearance at the ball last night, Prince.</p>

<h5 class="name count_r">[1]COUNT R.</h5> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_laughing_).</p> <p>I believe he thought the Nihilists had broken
    into the palace and carried you off.</p>

<h5 class="name baron_raff">BARON RAFF.</h5> <p>If they had you would have missed a charming dance.[1]</p>

<h5 class="name prince_paul">PRINCE PAUL.</h5> <p>And[2] an excellent supper. Gringoire really excelled
    himself in his salad. Ah! you may laugh, Baron; but to make a good salad
    is a much more difficult thing than cooking accounts. To make a good
    salad is to be a brilliant diplomatist--the problem is so entirely the
    same in both cases. To know exactly how much oil one must put with one's
    vinegar.</p>

<h5 class="name baron_raff">BARON RAFF.</h5> <p>A cook and a diplomatist! an excellent parallel. If I had a
    son who was a fool I'd make him one or the other.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_paul">PRINCE PAUL.</h5> <p>I see your father did not hold the same opinion, Baron.
    But, believe me, you are wrong to run down cookery. For myself, the only
    immortality I desire is to invent a new sauce. I have never had time
    enough to think seriously about it, but I feel it is in me, I feel it is
    in me.</p>

<h5 class="name czare">CZARE.</h5> <p>You have certainly missed your _metier_,[3] Prince Paul; the
    _cordon bleu_ would have suited you much better than the Grand Cross of
    Honour. But you know you could never have worn your white apron well;
    you would have soiled it too soon, your hands are not clean enough.</p>

<h5 class="name prince_paul">PRINCE PAUL</h5> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_bowing_).</p> <p>Que voulez vous? I manage your father's
    business.</p>

<h5 class="name czare">CZARE.</h5> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_bitterly_).</p> <p>You mismanage my father's business, you mean! Evil
    genius of his life that you are! before you came there was some love
    left in him. It is you who have embittered his nature, poured into his
    ear the poison of treacherous counsel, made him hated by the whole
    people, made him what he is--a tyrant!</p>

<p class="stage_directions hover">(_The courtiers look significantly at each other._)</p>

<h5 class="name prince_paul">PRINCE PAUL</h5> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_calmly_).</p> <p>I see your Highness does want change of air. But
    I have been an eldest son myself.</p> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_Lights a cigarette._)</p> <p>I know what it
        is when a father won't die to please one.</p>

<p class="stage_directions hover">(_The CZAREVITCH goes to the top of the stage, and leans against the
    window, looking out._)</p>
