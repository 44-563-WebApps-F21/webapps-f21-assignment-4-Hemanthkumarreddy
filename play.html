<h3>Vera, or the Nihilists</h3>

<h4>ACT 2 - This shows the description about the Act 2 in Vera, or the Nihilists. 
    I have extracted my few lines in the play.</h4>

<pre>
    <h4>SCENE.--_</h4><p>Council Chamber in the Emperor's Palace, hung with yellow
        tapestry. Table, with chair of State, set for the Czar; window behind,
        opening on to a balcony. As the scene progresses the light outside gets
        darker._</p>

<h4>_Present._--</h4><p>PRINCE PAUL MARALOFFSKI, PRINCE PETROVITCH, COUNT ROUVALOFF,
    BARON RAFF, COUNT PETOUCHOF.</p>


<h4>PRINCE PETRO.</h4> <p>So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
    at last, and is to take his seat here again.</p>

<h4>PRINCE PAUL.</h4> <p>Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
    own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.</p>

<h4>PRINCE PETRO.</h4> <p>Naturally; you are always speaking.</p>

<h4>PRINCE PAUL.</h4> <p>No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.</p>

<h4>COUNT R.</h4> <p>Still, anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
    like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.</p>

<h4>PRINCE PAUL.</h4> <p>My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
    world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
    to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place.</p> <p>(_Enter the
        CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._)</p> <p>Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
    Highness is looking a little pale to-day.</p>

<h4>CZARE.</h4> <p>(_slowly, after a pause_).</p> <p>I want change of air.</p>

<h4>PRINCE PAUL</h4> <p>(_smiling_).</p> <p>A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial
    father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in
    Russia.</p>

<h4>CZARE.</h4> <p>(_bitterly_).</p> <p>My Imperial father had kept me for six months in
    this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see
    some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery,
    though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.</p>

<h4>PRINCE PAUL.</h4> <p>When you are as old as I am, Prince, you will understand
    that there are few things easier than to live badly and to die well.</p>

<h4>CZARE.</h4> <p>Easy to die well! A lesson experience cannot have taught you,
    whatever you may know of a bad life.</p>

<h4>PRINCE PAUL</h4> <p>(_shrugging his shoulders_).</p> <p>Experience, the name men give
    to their mistakes. I never commit any.</p>

<h4>CZARE.</h4> <p>(_bitterly_).</p> <p>No; crimes are more in your line.</p>

<h4>PRINCE PETRO.</h4> <p>(_to the CZAREVITCH_).</p> <p>The Emperor was a good deal
    agitated about your late appearance at the ball last night, Prince.</p>

<h4>[1]COUNT R.</h4> <p>(_laughing_).</p> <p>I believe he thought the Nihilists had broken
    into the palace and carried you off.</p>

<h4>BARON RAFF.</h4> <p>If they had you would have missed a charming dance.[1]</p>

<h4>PRINCE PAUL.</h4> <p>And[2] an excellent supper. Gringoire really excelled
    himself in his salad. Ah! you may laugh, Baron; but to make a good salad
    is a much more difficult thing than cooking accounts. To make a good
    salad is to be a brilliant diplomatist--the problem is so entirely the
    same in both cases. To know exactly how much oil one must put with one's
    vinegar.</p>

<h4>BARON RAFF.</h4> <p>A cook and a diplomatist! an excellent parallel. If I had a
    son who was a fool I'd make him one or the other.</p>

<h4>PRINCE PAUL.</h4> <p>I see your father did not hold the same opinion, Baron.
    But, believe me, you are wrong to run down cookery. For myself, the only
    immortality I desire is to invent a new sauce. I have never had time
    enough to think seriously about it, but I feel it is in me, I feel it is
    in me.</p>

<h4>CZARE.</h4> <p>You have certainly missed your _metier_,[3] Prince Paul; the
    _cordon bleu_ would have suited you much better than the Grand Cross of
    Honour. But you know you could never have worn your white apron well;
    you would have soiled it too soon, your hands are not clean enough.</p>

<h4>PRINCE PAUL</h4> <p>(_bowing_).</p> <p>Que voulez vous? I manage your father's
    business.</p>
